# Regression Task

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of two regression models to predict a continuous target variable based on input features. The task involves:
1. Creating a regression model using **Algorithm 1**.
2. Creating a regression model using **Algorithm 2**.
3. Writing a report comparing the performance of the two models and suggesting improvements.
